The criteria for becoming a core contributor is to participate at least once per month over a period of 3 months. Participation could include providing feedback in the Translations working group meetings, providing feedback on docs, or making other contributions on GitHub (commits / issues). People not participating over a 3 month period may be removed as core contributors.

If you'd like to be on our squad, an easy way to start is by going through the issue list and fixing some or adding to the conversation.
